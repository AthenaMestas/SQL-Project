# How did this SQL analysis project solve business intelligence challenges for the networking equipment company, Quantigration? How can the implemented tactics be used in future applications? 
To solve Quantigration's business intelligence challenges, a few key methods were implemented. First, regional sales trends were identified to optimize marketing strategies. Next, high-return products were pinpointed for quality control improvement guidance. Third, data-driven SQL queries were used to provide actionable insights on customer, order, and RMA databases. Regarding such usage for future applications, these strategies can help with inventory management adjustments, geographically-based marketing campaigns, and product quality investigations.
# What were the project's strengths?
In this project a comprehensive analysis was given, documentation was clear, and the work done stayed focused on business objectives. The analysis covered sales, returns, and regional comparisons. Documentation for the queries gave a clear label with their purpose, a screenshot of the workspace, and the code used for error checking and ease of re-creating the analysis.
# In what areas could the project improve?
The project would have been greatly improved by reinforcing the safety of the coded queries and adding enhanced visuals for a wider audience. Added error handling would have handled missing data or NULL values more gracefully. Integration of charts/graphs, such as pie charts or bar graphs, could have complimented the findings well and could have aided the process of communicating the results.
